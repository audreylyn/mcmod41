### Account Setup

Before students can log in or create an account, they must first approach their **Department Administrator** to fill out a **Data Privacy Form**. Once the form is completed, the Department Administrator will **automatically import the student’s and teacher’s information into the system**, which will then be used to **create their user accounts**.&#x20;

After this process, you’ll receive your **institutional login credentials** (email and password) to access the MCiSmartSpace platform.

### Navigation Menu
